This thesis introduces DroneDSL, a domain-specific language designed to enhance drone mission planning, especially for reconnaissance operations. The current state of drone mission planning has two main challenges. The first challenge stems from the complexity of integrating software and hardware functionalities, which complicates operations for pilots and limits the potential for code reusability among developers. To address this, DroneDSL offers an abstraction layer, simplifying interaction with drone systems and promoting developer efficiency through reusable code modules. The second challenge involves the need for dynamic mission execution capable of supporting complex logical operations such as looping and conditional execution, which surpass the capabilities of existing drone-specific languages designed for straightforward, linear mission plans. By incorporating a finite state machine, DroneDSL enables drones to adapt their missions dynamically in response to changing conditions, significantly enhancing the expressiveness and effectiveness of drone operations in reconnaissance and beyond.
