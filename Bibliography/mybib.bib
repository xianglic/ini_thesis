abstract = {This paper describes protocol designed for communication between UAV and base station. It is intended to send control commands towards to the drone and telemetry data towards to the base station. The requirements were usability in radio link with low data throughput, ability to detect and overcome data loss and providing low latency. Regarding to the safety aspect also secure variant of the protocol was designed.}
